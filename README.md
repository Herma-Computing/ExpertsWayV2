# ExpertsWay

A new Educational mobile app.

## Getting Started

This app is useful to learn, program and practice your coding daily with up-to-date content. Explore the app library of coding courses and get help from our community of fellow code learners when you need it. Build code, master algorithms and data structures, create software focused on machine learning, learn to interpret design patterns, and compete in fun coding games against other developers.


Contribution
------------

Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

To create a pull request, you can follow these steps:

    Fork the Repository:
        Visit the repository's GitHub page.
        Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page.
        This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

    Clone the Forked Repository:
        Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
        Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
        Open your terminal or Git client.
        Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone the forked repository to your local machine.

    Create a New Branch:
        Change to the repository's directory using the cd command.
        Create a new branch for your changes using the git checkout command.
        For example: git checkout -b my-new-branch.
        This will create and switch to a new branch named "my-new-branch" (you can choose any name you prefer).

    Make and Commit your Changes:
        Make the necessary changes to the code or files in your local repository using your preferred text editor or IDE.
        Once you have made your changes, save the files.
        Use the git status command to see the modified files.
        Add the changes to the staging area using the git add command.
        For example, to add all changes: git add .
        Commit the changes with a descriptive message using the git commit command.
        For example: git commit -m "Added new feature"

    Push the Changes:
        Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub using the git push command.
        For example: git push origin my-new-branch
        This will upload your branch with the committed changes to GitHub.

    Create the Pull Request:
        Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
        You should see a highlighted message with a button to create a pull request from your branch.
        Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
        Review your changes and provide a descriptive title and comment for the pull request.
        Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit your pull request.
